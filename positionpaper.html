              <h4>POSITION PAPER GUIDELINES</h4>
              <p>A paper that explains the position of the country addressing a specific issue that will be discussed in the council. An effective position paper should contain five following parts:<br><br>
                <b>·     Topic Background</b><br>
              The topic background generally defines any key terms and major points related to the particular issue at hand and provides a brief history of the issue and potential consequences of ignoring the said issue.<br><br>
              <b>·     Past International Actions</b><br>
              This portion of the paper addresses the efforts made by the UN and your specific country to combat the issue at hand. Mention what UN programs, events, decisions, and agreements your country has participated in. Also take note of other participants in these efforts as they could serve as important allies.<br><br>
              <b>·     Country Policy</b><br>
              This section should summarize your country’s  stance on the issue at hand and what they believe the international community could help to resolve the issue. Here, delegates must remember that this area consists of their country’s policy, rather than their own perspective on an issue. If your country does not completely condemn an unethical practice, because of their own stakes in the practice, then your policy must reflect that, in spite of your disagreement.Some ways to better understand  your country’s policy are: Finding speeches from your country’s leaders, researching the officialgovernment’s website, and evaluating their actions and policy.<br><br>
              <b>·     Possible Solutions</b><br>
              What solutions do you propose for the topic being discussed? What results does your country expect by the end of the conference?<br><br>
              <b>·     Sources/References</b><br>
              In your research paper, you should ensure that your information comes from reliable source. Having a solid, UN-based source increases your credibility and helps to develop a thorough understanding of the issue at hand. Take into account credible websites like un.org and seek university studies. Government and NGO websites can be credible but understand that they could possess a bias. Similarly, information provided by news websites and blogs might not be as credible as un.org.<br><br>
              <b>Formats for the position paper:</b><br>
              1.   Written in English Only<br>
                2.   Titled in the following format: [Country]_[Council Name]_Position Paper<br>

                <h4>SAMPLE OF POSITION PAPER</h4>
                <p>Council Allotted         : Decent Work and Economic Group (SDG -8)<br>
                    Topic                           : “Impact of COVID-19 on economy”<br>
                    Country Allocated:       Bhutan <br>
                    Delegate                     : Sourav Chandra   <br>     
                     
                    During this Covid-19 outbreak, the Himalayan kingdom of Bhutan has done well in keeping the number of infections as just 70 documented cases of COVID-19 in the country with no deaths, and next to no job losses by  24th June 2020. The economy of Bhutan, one of the world's smallest and least developed economies, is based on agriculture and forestry. However, the main source of revenue is the sale of electricity to India. Moreover, the country has sustained growth due to the development of the hydroelectric sector and the dynamism of the tourism sector. Additionally, growth was estimated to have risen to 5.3% in 2019 from 3.7% a year earlier higher power exports, and household consumption provided support. This was also 0.4 percentage point higher than IMF's previous estimate for growth. Furthermore, strong power exports are expected to boost GDP growth to 2.7% in 2020 and 2.9% in 2021; however, the impact on the economy could have been stronger if the COVID-19 pandemic had not broken out.<br><br>
                     
                    Equally, the government is working on the 12th five-year plan (2019-2023), which will focus on decentralization from national to local governments, by almost doubling the share of resources allocated and by increasing their authority and functions. Likewise, National self-sufficiency and inclusive socio-economic growth also remain among the pillars of the new five-year plan, meaning the government will pursue an expansive budgetary policy. Debt-to-GDP ratio fell grew to 108.6% from 102.4% in 2018; however, most debt is considered sustainable as they are covered by financial arrangements with India under which the latter finances the construction of hydropower plan in Bhutan in exchange of power imports. At the same time, government debt is anticipated to slow gradually to 105.7% of GDP in 2020 and 101% in 2021. Bhutan is also the first country using the Gross National Happiness index to measure the well-being of its population not only based on economic indicators, but also on other factors summarized in the four GNH pillars: sustainable and equitable socio-economic development, environmental conservation, preservation and promotion of culture and good governance.<br><br>
                     
                    Regarding, impact of Covid-19, the initial closure of the border of Bhutan was implemented on March 24, 2020. Additionally, the World Bank has flagged that agriculture, construction, and export sectors are likely to be badly hit owing to labor shortages and lower external demand, and this trend is likely to continue till 2021. The disruption in the regular food imports caused by the COVID-19 pandemic has once again exposed the country's vulnerability in food security requiring about Nu. 944 million or an equivalent of 31 percent of the 12th Plan budget allotted for the sector. Similarly, tourism is the worst-hit sector in Bhutan. The livelihood of 50,000 citizens depends on this or allied sectors. UN World Tourism Organization has predicted a plunge of up to 30 percent in international arrivals and a loss of $300-$450 billion. Prime Minister of India Narendra Modi also agreed to the reprioritization of activities and projects supported by India under the 12th Plan. India has committed assistance of Nu. 4,500 crores and additional Nu. 400 crore for transitional trade support facility.<br><br>
                    However, Yeshey Penjor, Bhutan's Minister for Agriculture, said, the "lockdown in India and the closure of border gates with India has allowed our farmers to substitute a large portion of the country's vegetable and meat requirements that are imported from India… We take the Covid-19 pandemic as a blessing in disguise and the pandemic has called for a test of sustainability".  Indeed, as stated by the Free Trade Agreement (FTA), trade between Bangladesh and Bhutan that amounted to $26.52 million in fiscal 2012-13 reached $57.90 million in fiscal 2018-19, according to data from the commerce ministry of Bangladesh. Additionally, the study partnered with the Oxford Poverty and Human Development Initiative (OPHI) in constructing a Multidimensional Vulnerability Index for Tourism (MVI-T). Eight core indicators of vulnerability were used, and they are Income Loss, Coping Strategy, Loss of Livelihood, Food Security, Limited Savings, Indebtedness, Vulnerable Household Members and Tourism Dependent. The study showed that almost one-third of respondents lost their jobs or have been put on unpaid leave. Around two-thirds of the households surveyed rely on tourism for livelihood and a vast majority of these households (three in four households) saw their income fall by 50 to 100 percent.<br><br>
 
                    Not only this the Asian Development Bank (ADB) approved a $20 million loan to support Bhutan's efforts to stimulate the economy, protect public health, and mitigate the effects of the novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic on its people. "ADB commends the government's quick actions in implementing strong public health measures for effective outbreak containment and formulating a pro-poor economic contingency plan to counteract the adverse impact of the pandemic on the people and the economy," said ADB President Masatsugu Asakawa. "This budget support will help the government implement its plans and ensure effective targeting of vulnerable groups, building on ADB's ongoing projects and long-standing development assistance to Bhutan in strengthening public health, and public sector and macroeconomic management. Admittedly, the COVID-19 Active Response and Expenditure Support (CARES) Program was established as part of ADB's $20 billion expanded assistance for developing member countries' COVID-19 response, which was announced on 13 April.<br><br>
                     
                    On the other hand, Bhutan uses the Covid-19 crisis to boost agriculture. The leader of the opposition, Pema Gyemtsho, said that the government should push agriculture to the top of the national agenda. It is a sector that employs 65% of the population and makes up 20% of the country's GDP. "The investment arm of the government, DHI (Druk Holding and Investments), must incorporate agriculture as an important avenue to strengthen Bhutan in the next decade." The DHI's investment in a dairy plant in Chenary in Trashigang was a good example. As a consequence, local government leaders in Trashigang, eastern Bhutan, have decided to promote local products. Also, schools will now be supplied with only local fruits, vegetables, and dairy products, among others.
